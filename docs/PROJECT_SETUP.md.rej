 ### Branch Protection Rules
 
-Enable these on your default branch:
+You can configure branch protection either via script (recommended) or manually through the GitHub UI.
+
+#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
+
+Use the included script to configure comprehensive branch protection:
+
+```bash
+# Set up branch protection with default settings
+uv run python scripts/setup_github_protection.py
+
+# Or specify custom settings
+uv run python scripts/setup_github_protection.py --enforce-admins --require-code-owner-reviews
+```
+
+The script configures:
+- Required pull request reviews before merging
+- Required status checks to pass
+- Enforce rules for administrators
+- Require signed commits
+- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
