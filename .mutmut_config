# Mutmut configuration for Template Sample
# See: https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#
# Mutation testing verifies that your tests actually catch bugs by introducing
# small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if tests fail.
#
# Usage:
#   mutmut run            # Run mutation testing
#   mutmut results        # Show results summary
#   mutmut show <id>      # Show details of a specific mutant
#   mutmut html           # Generate HTML report

# Test command to run (fast, fail-fast for efficiency)

# Mutation score threshold (percentage) - uncomment to enforce
